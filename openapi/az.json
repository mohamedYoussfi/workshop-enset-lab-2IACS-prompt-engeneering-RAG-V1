  "question": "What course of action should ABC Ecommerce take to overcome the supplier shortage problem on its main product line, smartphones?",
  "thought": "In considering the options available, diversifying suppliers could help in reducing dependency on a single supplier and reduce the risk of shortages, but it might also increase operational complexity. Improving the supply chain visibility and collaboration could help in better planning and managing inventory, but it might not solve the problem of supply shortage. Exploring inhouse manufacturing or partnership opportunities could also be an option, but it might require significant investment and time.",
  "action": "Diversify suppliers and products.",
  "reason": "Diversifying suppliers would help to mitigate the risk of supplier shortage. In case one supplier is facing issues, the company would not be entirely dependent on that supplier and could get the same product from other suppliers. It would also give the company better bargaining power. Diversifying products would help in reducing the dependency on one product line and could open up new revenue streams.",
  "steps": [
    "Step 1: Conduct market research to identify potential new suppliers who can meet the company's quality and quantity requirements.",
    "Step 2: Reach out to potential suppliers and negotiate terms.",
    "Step 3: Gradually shift some of the orders to the new suppliers to test their reliability.",
    "Step 4: Conduct market research to identify potential new products that are in demand and align with the company's existing product portfolio.",
    "Step 5: Add the new products to the company's portfolio and promote them to customers.",
    "Step 6: Monitor the performance of the new suppliers and products and adjust the strategy as necessary."
